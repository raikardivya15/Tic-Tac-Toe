# Tic-Tac-Toe

Mobile-friendly Tic Tac Toe game with a dark theme, bubble-style buttons, scoreboard, and a full-screen result overlay.

## Features
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- Clean dark (black) aesthetic  
- Keeps score for Player X, Player O, and Draws across rounds  
- Full-screen 
- Accessible keyboard + touch support

## Demo
Open `index.html` in any modern browser (mobile or desktop) to play.

## Files
- `index.html` — game markup and templates  
- `style.css` — styles (dark theme)  
- `script.js` — game logic (board, win detection, scoreboard, overlay)

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repo.  
2. Ensure the three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same folder.  
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- Click or tap a cell to place X or O (two-player local).  
- When a round ends, the overlay shows the result and a **New Game** button — scores persist until you refresh or reset them.  
- Use the keyboard (Enter/Space to play, Arrow keys to navigate) for accessibility.

## Customization
- Change colors in `:root` of `style.css`.  
- Replace the overlay/button styles to modify appearance or animations.
